# Energy Efficiency

## Project Overview
10 AI energy reduction techniques derived from perfect number arithmetic.
No knowledge of underlying theory required to use them.
Extracted from TECS-L -- standalone technique library.

## Parent Project
Part of the TECS-L family. Mathematical foundation at https://github.com/need-singularity/TECS-L

## Techniques (10)
```
  techniques/
    phi6simple.py          -- Cyclotomic activation (71% FLOPs reduction)
    hcn_dimensions.py      -- HCN tensor alignment (10-20% param reduction)
    phi_bottleneck.py      -- 4/3x FFN expansion (67% param reduction)
    phi_moe.py             -- phi/tau expert activation (65% active params)
    entropy_early_stop.py  -- Entropy-based stopping (66.7% training)
    rfilter_phase.py       -- R-filter phase detection
    takens_dim6.py         -- Loss curve embedding diagnostic
    fft_mix_attention.py   -- FFT attention (3x faster, +0.55%)
    zetaln2_activation.py  -- zeta*ln(2) gated activation (71% FLOPs)
    egyptian_moe.py        -- 1/2+1/3+1/6=1 expert routing

## Quick Run
```bash
# Individual technique demos
python3 techniques/phi6simple.py
python3 techniques/fft_mix_attention.py
python3 techniques/egyptian_moe.py

# Combined architecture experiment
python3 experiments/experiment_h_ee_11_combined_architecture.py
```

## Key Results
```
  Cyclotomic activation:    71% FLOPs reduction
  FFT attention:            3x faster, +0.55% accuracy
  Egyptian MoE routing:     1/2+1/3+1/6=1 expert allocation
  phi bottleneck:           67% parameter reduction
  Entropy early stopping:   33% training time saved
```

## Background Execution
All experiments must run in background. No exceptions.
```
  Rules:
    1. All python3 scripts -> run_in_background: true
    2. Check results with Read after completion
    3. No foreground execution (blocks user dialogue)
```
